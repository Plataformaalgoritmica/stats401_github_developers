[r267469:271228]\n\nGeneral:\n  - More nullability annotations.\n  - Continuing work on encryption support.\n  - Fix uses of deprecated API.\n\nConfigurations:\n  - Enabled CLANG_WARN_INFINITE_RECURSION and CLANG_WARN_SUSPICIOUS_MOVE\n\nScripts:\n  - BuildStringsFromTarget now ignores \"empty\" output files.\n  - Added couple more of our helper scripts, ChangeStringEncoding and\n    DumpEmbeddedPlist.\n  - rubylib/xcworkspace.rb #add_dir_ref now handles folder references\n    appropriately.\n\nOmniBase:\n  - Extend -[NSError(OBExtensions) causedByMissingFile] to also include\n    NSOSStatusErrorDomain/fnfErr on the Mac. We see this in practice from some\n    OFSFileManager instances.\n  - Added `-[OBLogger processLogFilesWithHandler:]`.\n  - Wrap `__attribute__((constructor))` function bodies with `@autoreleasepool`.\n  - Added an ARM variant for `_OBStopInDebugger`.\n  - Added a modulemap for OmniBase on watchOS.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n  - Added `+ (id)addObserverForPreference:(nullable OFPreference *)preference\n    usingBlock:(void (^)(OFPreference *preference))block`.\n  - Updated our +remove:fromReferences: debug assertion to stop giving false\n    positives when removing a weak reference during an object's -dealloc method.\n  - Added support for comparing two similar weak references with -isEqual:,\n    so you can remove a weak reference by creating a new weak reference to\n    the same object and using -removeObject:.\n  - When creating a temporary OFWeakReference to remove a matching\n    weak reference, we now use the API -initWithDeallocatingObject: which\n    doesn't try to take out a new weak reference.\n  - Added Some NOESCAPE annotations\n  - Reworked OFXMLParser so that we can handle unparsed elements without access\n    to a contiguous buffer representing the entire docucument.\n  - Add -[NSArray(OFExtensions) any:], a sibling to -all:\n  - Did a nullification pass in NSFileCoordinator(OFExtensions) to make it\n    easier to use in Swift. But Swift doesn't support bridging throwing\n    closures, it still isn't great. This probably calls for writing a Swift\n    wrapper in OmniFoundation that hides the ugly.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n  - Convert NSView-OAExtensions to ARC in order to fix a crashing bug involving\n    a zombie.\n  - Define OAPlatformColorClass.\n  - Added a hook for OAAppearance subclasses to specify a bundle other than\n    their own in which to look for their plist.\n  - Update NSAttributedString extension method drawInRectangle:alignment:verticallyCentered:\n    to draw using API that handles truncation appropriately (since 10.5).\n  - Factored out -isLightLuma: instead of repeating it in the iOS and Mac sides\n    of this code (and making available for use elsewhere).\n  - Give OAWebPageViewer's WebView its own independent .preferenceIdentifier,\n    so changing the preference settings for one of them doesn't affect the\n    settings for the others.\n  - Use dispatch_once() to initialize the combined color table used by\n    +colorWithSimilarName: and -similarColorNameFromColorLists in a\n    thread-safe way.\n  - Updated OALabelField to disallow vibrancy.\n  - Copying the \"CredentialsPrompt\" class from OmniFocus down into OmniAppKit\n    (as OAPassphrasePrompt) and generalizing it for use with document encryption.\n  - Changed -[NSWindow addConstructionWarning] to always add the bar at the top\n    of the list of title view accessor controllers.\n  - Moved OASwoopView to the obsolete group.\n\nOmniInspector:\n  - Don’t delay for a double-click except when it’s the selected cell.\n    This makes tab-switching faster, because you don’t have that\n    double-click delay.\n  - Updated to avoid vibrancy in attached inspectors.\n  - Deleted -[OITabbedInspector shouldHideTabWithIdentifier:], which is a hook\n    for subclasses to hide tabs.\n  - Support for the app delegate to decide that certain inspector tabs should\n    just not be loaded.\n  - Support for inspecting text views in the content area of a document with\n    attached inspectors.\n\nOmniSoftwareUpdate:\n  - Updated for the Mac App Store requiring the OSUCheckService XPC service\n    having a registered bundle identifier.\n  - Copy handler block to avoid a crash.\n  - Give each WebView its own independent .preferenceIdentifier.\n  - Make sure we're not passing nil data to -[NSXMLDocument initWithData:options:error:]\n  - Add iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to the OSU device list\n  - Stop using http when fetching track info for our software update feeds.\n    This lets us get rid of the ATS exception for update.omnigroup.com.\n  - Invoke -processTrackInformation: on the main queue.\n\nOIF:\n  - Removed this framework\n\nOWF:\n  - Converted to ARC.\n  - Replaced the OWFWeakRetain protocol (and its implementations) with\n    __weak references.\n  - Fixed deprecated API usage in OWFileProcessor.\n\nOmniDataObjects:\n  - Make sure that we fill in outError when we return NO\n    from FetchObjectFaultWithContext.\n  - Use the error's description, not its plist representation, when logging.\n  - Updated the insert and update object validation in ODOEditingContext to\n    use fast enumeration instead of CFSetApplyFunction.\n  - Removed deprecated RunUnitTests shell script from build phase.\n  - Add a missing type to an ODODatabase method parameter.\n  - Fixed an over-release of the objectID in an error case in\n    _fetchObjectCallback in ODOEditingContext-Internal.m\n  - Added a convenience to run a SQL SUM statement over an attribute in\n    the database.\n  - Fleshed out missing support for ODOAttributeTypeInt64.\n\nOmniFileExchange:\n  - Better support for macOS Sierra's syncing of ~/Documents and ~/Desktop.\n    If an account's sync folder is on your Desktop or in your Documents folder,\n    we return a \"Local documents folder cannot be used\" error and refuse to sync.\n\nOmniUI/iPad-Document:\n  - Support for 1Password integration when adding server account.\n\nOmniUI/iPad:\n  - Update for iOS 10 removing URL-ificition of links in UITextView.\n  - Add an option to OUIPasswordAlert to require passphrase confirmation.\n  - Support for deferring URL actions while the app is locked.\n\nOmniUnzip:\n  - -[OUUnzipArchive unzipArchiveToURL:error:] now allows its target directory\n    to exist, unzipping its contents alongside any existing files\n  - Added a method to OUUnzipArchive to get input stream for an entry rather\n    than an NSData instance\n  - Factoring out some zipfile <--> NSFileWrapper code from OmniUI-Internal.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2016-09-30 13:49:42-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2016-08-11 12:30:10-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Updated with changes from OmniGroup svn [r265076:267469]\n\nGeneral:\n  -

Disable syncing for the inner folder and report an error.\n  - Disable syncing on an account if too many errors happen in a short period of time.\n  - Improve reliability of reported error and last sync date in the activity classes.\n  - Keep track of recent redirects and use those to avoid further redirects in the same sync operation.\n  - In Mac accounts, avoid re-resolving our security scoped bookmark when we don't need to since this releases our sandbox privledges briefly and we might be syncing that account.\n  - If a directory scan fails, note that and don't report documents as missing. On the next sync, make sure to retry the scan.\n  - Added some testing hooks for configuring whether and how often we delete old versions on the server.\n  - Removed stuff about configuration cellular access since Settings.app controls this now.\n  - Added support for deleting stale versions of documents, in case they didn't get cleaned up by a prior sync (device put to sleep, connection lost, etc).\n  - Added OFFileMotionResult for describing the result of a move or copy in a file coordination safe way.\n  - Fix cases where credentials could be discarded if conformance tests failed.\n  - Fix a bug where we could interpret network conneciton loss as a conflict.\n  - When we get a 'stale' bookmark, we now rearchive the bookmark data.\n  - We no longer require the WebDAV server to return ETags since we don't use them.\n\nOmniFileStore:\n  - Continued working on encryption support.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n  - Added support for writing ICC colorspace data in a external table when archiving colors to plists.\n  - Declare +[OAApplication sharedApplication] as returning instancetype.\n  - Removed our home-grown support for sheet request queuing as AppKit does this better now.\n  - Fix possible infinite loop in target selection search.\n  - Added support for displaying/editing/resetting configuration values and handling change URLs.\n  - Fix a crash that can happen when clicking on a AppleScript-backed toolbar item after the script has been removed.\n  - Fix a crash that can happen when validating toolbar items in a window that is being torn down.\n  - Add support for Yosemite-style button toolbar items via a 'hasButton' key in the .toolbar file.\n  - Add strings files for crayon color names.\n  - Work around crash in the text system where _NSLayoutManagerRulerHelper is asked for -defaultLineHeightForFont: but doesn't respond (19771353)\n  - Added more helpers for constructing constraints.\n  - Added debug logging support for vibrant views.\n  - Updated support for performing blocks before a window is displayed to include per-window support.\n  - Improved font matching in OAFontDescriptor.\n  - Improved performance of OAResizingTitleBarButton.\n  - Fixed rare crash when closing the window for a OAWebPageViewer.

So now, we do the anonymous hardware details collection and software update query in a background XPC service.\n  - Removed use of some deprecated SMJob functions that we used in our priviledge install helper (for when the updating app isn't writable by the current user). We now write a new version of our helper tool in the (rare) case that the XPC protocol changes rather than trying to remove the old one when a downgrade would have been necessary.\n  - Switched to storing user-wide settings for software update into a group container preference domain instead of requiring a special entitlement for the share preference domain.\n  - Added a new version of the OpenGL extension compaction encoding that better reflects the set of extensions commonly available today.\n  - Apply extension compaction to the OpenCL extensions.\n  - Added support for custom queyr keys in reports.\n  - Build the the HTML in code for the description of what info will be reported. This allows for localization of individual pieces more naturally.\n  - Stop using NSDate for run-time calculation, using clock_get_time() instead (since the latter doesn't increment while the machine is asleep and doesn't change when ntp changes the system time).\n  - Improved user confirmation support for sending OSU stats on iOS.\n  - Fixed the split view style when showing updates.\n  - Fixed escape/cmd-period in the updates window.\n  - Updated preference pane icons for Yosemite.\n\nOmniUI/Common:\n  - Clean up of file presenter code in OUIAppearance\n  - Add support for NSImage-typed properties, with the image based on a name, bundle name, and tint color string/dictionary.\n  - Add support for UIImage-typed properties, with similar options.\n  - Add support for explicitly float- or double-typed properties (CGFloat will duplicate one of these based on architecture).

This helps paper over the mess created by ARC inserting tons of extra retains/releases and Instruments Leaks event matching being so poorly done.\n- Whitelist some more bad system API in OBRuntimeCheck.\n- Remove GC-only helper functions\n- Add some ARC helpers that wrap ObjC API that is disallowed when -fobjc-arc is enabled\n- Add some more objc_msgSend wrapper functions (OBCallObjectReturnIMPWithObject, etc.)\n\nOmniFoundation:\n- Updated to be ARC friendly, but the extra ref counts added by ARC make low level code more of a performance issue, so this framework isn't converted to ARC.\n- Replaced OFLockRegion_Begin/OFLockRegion_End with OFWithLock(), taking a block.\n- OFNetStateRegistration now keeps track of whether it is invalidate and doesn't assert that the timer firing it its timer (which will have been nilled out).\n- Added OFNetStateMock.[hm] which has one-process replacements for OFNetStateRegistration and OFNetStateNotifier. Currently these are used unconditionally in the OmniFileExchange tests, but they should be made conditional (well, you can comment out the registration line to \"configure\" it).\n- Fix an assertion failure when quickly invalidating OFNetState* classes and setting up new lines (like in the tests). We can get told that services are disappearing that we never heard about their appearance.\n- Rename the 'state' property on OFNetStateRegistration to 'localState' to avoid getting confused with the methods on NSCell, NSButton, and NSMenuItem.\n- Added unit tests for OFMutableKnownKeyDictionary\n- Added unit tests for OFTrie, fixed a long standing bug they exposed\n- Added OFPerformanceMeasurement\n- Add an iOS framework target\n- Removed -afterDelay:performBlock:, replacing it with OFAfterDelayPerformBlock().\n- Enabled bundle support in OFBundleRegistry on iOS now that there are frameworks\n- Added support for 'registration' files that are more easily shared between Mac/iOS and can do all the OFRegistrations stuff instead of just user defaults.\n- Added OFPerformInBackground() which makes a one-shot operation queue\n- Added -[NSIndexSet complementOverRange:] convenience method for finding the relative complement of an index set with respect to a given range.\n- Fix a problem where NSNetService entries would sometimes pass a TXT record data of <00> to OFNetStateNotifier after passing their real data. Possibly a new bug with 10.10, but we've not isolated it yet\n\nOmniSoftwareUpdate:\n- Fix some -Wshadow warnings\n- Updated iOS strings on preferences view to fit smaller spaces\n\nOmniAppKit:\n- Updated Help support to allow apps to specify the size of the help window\n- Added -[OAController openURL:] funnel point for subclassers to intercept\n- Add a framework target for iOS\n- Added NSWindow -convertPointToScreen: and -convertPointFromScreen: convenience methods\n- Use NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController for the construction-tape view used in our betas instead of injecting it directly into private parts of the view hierarchy\n- Fixed some issues with font lookup in OAFontDescriptor\n- Added helper code to OADocument to disallow saves to the app wrapper\n\nOmniInspector:\n- Updates for ARC friendliness changes in OmniFoundation\n- More fixes for floating vs. docked inspectors\n- Updates for Yosemite look and feel\n\nOmniDAV:\n- Add better support for injecting extra strings into the user agent header\n- Fix crash due to race condition in setting up the token delimiter set\n- Updated `odav` command to termindate when async commands are done\n\nOmniDocumentStore:\n- Add a new ODSFilter initializer that searches all the fileItems of a scope, and rename the top-level-only initializer to be more explicit\n- Updated approach to instantiating documents from templates\n\nOmniFileExchange:\n- Fixed a rare-ish race condition in conflict handling where two clients could attempt to rename the same files to different file names, ... resulting in conflicts, repeat. Now, conflict renames are local-only. All clients observing the conflict will rename the user-visible files to indicate the conflict, but the user-intended document name won't be changed on the server until the user manually renames one of the conflicting files.\n- We no longer have a notion of 'shadowed' file while there are name-based conflicts.\n- Name based conflicts no longer rename the server version of the file, and in fact any number of files on the server can stake a claim to the same relative path\n- Instead, we have a new client file state, 'automove': when there is a name conflict, all the conflicting files are assigned new conflict names. Edits can happen to those files and the desired names will not be updated on the server. This avoids the buggy case where one or more observing clients notices the conflict and attempts to resolve it by renaming the files, possibly leading to further conflicts.\n- When a file is renamed by the user, if that name is the original name, the other files have their conflict names finalized as their real names\n- If a file is left as the only automove'd file (the other versions are deleted or renamed away), then it is given back its desired name\n- We now post the last edited user name and host name in the server's Info.plist. If this is present, we use it when generating the conflict file name for that file.\n- Added more tests, including one that provokes the bad case.\n- We no longer attempt to intuit moves by NSFilePresenter notifications, but rather do inode-based match ups.\n- Metadata updates are now deferred and coalesced.\n- We keep track of moves we've noticed while scanning and apply them in bulk so that name swaps are detected by our inode matching\n- In the case of too many errors, we now automatically pause syncing, rather than flooding the server\n- Improved unit tests\n- OFXServerAccount instances can no only be either for document syncing or import/export, not both (can make two account instances if both facilities are desired)\n\nOmniUI:\n- Added support for more types of properties on OUIAppearance\n- Added support for user-overrides of appearance values via property lists placed in the right spot (with NSFilePresenter support for dynamically updating them)\n- Cache values computed via dynamic accessors\n- Add support for aliases\n- Add better support for subclasses and splitting up appearance plists\n- Changed OUITextView delegate method -textViewShouldPreserveStylesWhenPasting: to -textViewShouldPreserveStylesWhenPasting:defaultValue:sender:.\n- Add OUIUndoBarButtonItemDelegate protocol with -viewControllerToPresentMenuForUndoBarButtonItem:\n- Add a OUIUndoManagerDidRemoveAllActionsNotification notification and make OUIUndoBarButtonItem observe it to update its state\n- Remove OUIUndoButtonController and use OUIMenuController for the popover\n- Added OUITransition and OUIVerticalSplitTransition.\n- Switched to new Photos API\n- Added OUINoteInspectorPane\n- Cleaned up special/debug URL handling\n- UIAlertController in a bunch of places where UIAlertView was before\n- Updated design for IAP\n- Lots of accessibility improvements\n- Lots of adaptability updates and rearrangement of the document picker views\n- ... lots of other updates for iOS 8", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2014-09-10 10:11:07-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2014-09-09 16:19:32-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Update build instructions to not reference the removed scripts.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2014-09-09 16:19:32-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2014-09-09 16:17:23-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Remove the old build scripts.\n\nMost people are likely using workspaces, so these scripts don't get much testing.

These also do different things\n  now.\n\n  We don't want to call -[UIDocument updateChangeCount:] directly when using\n  NSUndoManager-based autosave support since the following pattern:\n\n    - make a real change (dirty)\n    - wait for autosave (not dirty)\n    - make a view state change (dirty)\n    - undo (not dirty, but previous change undone)\n\n  would make UIDocument think it had no changes when it really did.\n\n  Now, OUIDocument keeps track of a view state version counter. It is\n  incremented each time -viewStateChanged is called and UIDocument's change\n  tracking methods have been subclassed to read/update the counter. UIKit\n  calls -hasUnsavedChanges when closing a document or backgrounding the app,\n  even if the NSUndoManager-based system hasn't started an autosave.\n  This means view state changes will not provoke an autosave (which is nice),\n  but they'll participate in autosave if it happens (also nice) and will get\n  saved at shutdown time (mostly nice, except for the possibility of spurious\n  iCloud conflicts due to view state changes).\n\n  Longer term, we should move view state out of the main file entirely.\n  There are maybe a few extra changes we can make to reduce the spurious\n  conflicts w/o changing the file format yet.\n  See <bug:///75660> (Think about editor state changes and iCloud conflicts).\n\n[r161147] We now dismiss popovers in the document view when changes come in\n  via iCloud.

If this\n  works out as we hope, will remove OUILongPressGestureRecognizer and possibly\n  rename things for clarity.\n- Switched some toolbar usage to use iOS 5 themeing support, but for some of\n  our needs we still have custom view toolbar items.\n\nTextEditor example:\n- Added iCloud support, though you'll need to register the app in your portal\n  account and possibly switch the bundle id in the app and entitlements.\n\nOWF:\n- Minor updates for API changes.\n- Move guts of -HMSStringFromTimeInterval: into OmniFoundation.\n- Avoid using deprecated security API, though this is marked OBFinishPorting.\n\nOmniBase:\n- Rewrote the OBDEPRECATED_METHODS macro to be OBDEPRECATED_METHOD, making it\n  work again with the latest clang builds.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n- Avoid using deprecated API on 10.7.\n- OAInternetConfig no longer uses Internet Config, but just Launch Services.\n- Deprecate our -currentModifierFlags and -checkForModifierFlags: methods,\n  prefering those now on NSEvent and new category methods thereon.\n- Fixed several bugs in OATargetSelection and do a first pass at incorporating\n  -responsibleTargetForAction:sender:.\n- OAController now explicitly conforms to NSApplicationDelegate and provides\n  OFController shims for the NSApp delegate calls.\n- Added OATinyPopUpButton from OmniPlan.\n- Fixed various implicit 64->32 cast warnings and precision issues in\n  OAGeometryTests.\n- Changed calculations in OACalendarView and names of variables so that doing\n  the date computations of where you clicked and what week is selected make\n  a lot more sense and aren't buggy.\n- Avoid crash OAColorWell when attempting to remove an unfound object.\n- Fixed a bug where if you did not have a date set when popping up a\n  OADatePicker, you were unable to set the date to the current date value\n  in the date picker.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n- Add support for LZMA compression.\n- Added +[OFVersionNumber isOperatingSystemiOS50OrLater].\n- Removed OFFileWrapper; with iOS 5 we now always have NSFileWrapper.\n- Ported some security related code away from the Security APIs deprecated in\n  10.7 to the new ones.\n- Added block support to OFFilterProcess.\n- Added NSArray(OFExtensions) -anyObjectSatisfiesPredicate:, taking a block.\n- Added NSSet(OFExtensions) -select:.\n- Added debug helper -[NSFileManager(OFExtensions) logPropertiesOfTreeAtURL:].\n  Useful for logging the contents of an iCloud container on the device, since\n  you can't go poking around directly.\n\nOmniQuartz:\n- Added +[CALayer(OQExtensions) mediaTimingFunctionForUIViewAnimationCurve:].\n- Add support for more layer properties when rendering trees as vectors.\n- Add OQLargestCenteredIntegralRectInRectWithAspectRatioAsSize().\n\nOmniInspector:\n- Turn on autocalculation of key view loops in the inspector windows.\n  Previously off since it didn't work very well.\n\nOmniNetworking:\n- OBFinishPorting deprecated -[NSPortCoder connection] call.\n\nOmniSoftwareUpdate:\n- Treat trial licenses the same way we treated expiring licenses.\n- Hide the price column if there's nothing in it.\n- Some preliminary work to support enclosureless items again.\n- We no longer start adjusting UI positions and selections before objects have\n  been loaded from the nib, losing those adjustments.\n- Avoid using a fixed-size buffer for OpenCL string queries.\n- Convert to @property syntax.\n\nOverall:\n- Fixed clang-sa warnings from newer Xcode builds.\n- Removed NS_BLOCKS_AVAILABLE guards since all our platforms now have them.\n- Trickle down of API changes from frameworks needed to avoid\n  deprecated API in 10.7", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-10-12 11:15:53-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-10-12 09:51:30-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Turn off optimization for debug builds; we always did locally anyway.\nOur automated build system will help find unused variables since it builds in Release mode.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-10-12 09:51:30-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-10-12 09:50:36-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Add a comment about -Wno-sign-conversion.

Useful for telling clang-sa about\n    unreachable conditions.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n  - Speed up key searches in OFKnownKeyDictionary.\n  - Add OFExtentIntersection().\n  - Add some more support to OFFileWrapper.\n    - Handle symlinks\n    - Handle preferred file name conflicts.\n    - Add serialization support (not byte compatible with NSFileWrapper,\n      just API compatible).\n  - Fixed some edge cases and bugs in 10.2/10.4 date format conversion.\n  - Extracted some backtrace logging stuff from OFController into OFBacktrace\n    for use on iOS.\n  - Cleaned up iOS support in OFBundleRegistry and enable more on iOS.\n  - Starting to remove the CDSA/CSSM references from OFXMLSignature's public\n    API.\n  - Add OFNetChangeNotifier, OFRelativeDateFormatter/Parser, and more\n    Foundation extensions to the iOS build.\n  - Fixed a crash encountered when calling -deepMutableCopy on an NSArray\n    which contains an NSCFBoolean:  every object responds to the\n    -mutableCopy selector (it's declared on NSObject), but not every\n    object actually conforms to the NSMutableCopying protocol.\n  - Fixed double archiving API on OFXML.\n\nOmniFileStore:\n  - Treat 406 result codes from PROPFIND the same as 404. This can happen\n    when a DAV server has multiviews turned on and suggests an alternate.\n    But since we are testing for the existance of a file, we don't want the\n    alternate.\n  - Added some UTI conveniences.\n  - Use the right locale and time zone when parsing dates.\n  - Fixed the WebDAV upload bug where choosing to rename the uploaded\n    document (rather than replacing the existing document) would generate\n    a bad HTTP request.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n  - Work around a lazy init bug in Cocoa scripting\n  - Add NSAttributedString(OAExtensions) to iOS\n  - Add locking for the global OAFontDescriptor uniquing table\n  - Add tab stop support on OAParagraphStyle and hook up scalars for mutable\n    paragraph styles.\n  - Hook up paragraph styles in OATextStorage\n  - Add OAFontDescriptorAttributeName, used in our other internal frameworks\n    to record the originally requested font descriptor (independent of the\n    closest font that was actually found).\n  - A bit more implementation of OATextStorage\n\nOmniQuartz:\n  - Handle cornerRadius in CALayer vector output path.\n  - Fall back to white for unarchiving HSV/pattern colors from XML on iOS\n    instead of hitting OBFinishPorting.\n  - Implement OQGetColorRefComponents() for iOS.\n  - Added a utility routine for drawing SVG-style paths. This isn't complete\n    (the translation of arcs is nontrivial) but it's potentially useful.\n\nOmniUI/Text:\n  - OUIEditableFrame now uses a text storage, somewhat similarly to the\n    Cocoa text system. This allows the text frame to edit its mutable contents\n    and respond to external mutations via -textStorageDidProcessEditing:.\n  - Extended support for span background colors with an optional filter block\n    to control which are drawn).\n  - Extended OUITextLayout rendering to allow control for whether to render\n    backgrounds, glyphs or both. This allows for proper layering of the\n    selection color in cases that need it.\n  - Added support for attempting to center the first line at a particular\n    y-offset.\n  - Added support for customizing inspector slices in text inspector.\n  - Fixed bugs with rounding at non-integral scales.\n  - Added support for losing first responder w/o ending editing. For example,\n    the font size inspector has an editable field for setting the size.\n  - Added more delegate hooks.\n  - Added some support for simulated super/subscript since CoreText doesn't\n    support it for arbitrary fonts.\n  - Tons of other bug fixes and improvements.\n\nOmniUI/Inspectors:\n  - Inspectors are now fixed height, specified when they are created. The\n    stack of slices is made scrollable if needed. Slices can still change\n    height, but the popover will always be the same height (well, unless\n    the keyboard forces it to be shorter).\n  - Worked around various bugs with UIPopoverController.\n  - Add support for a 'None' color type. Slices that allow 'None' also have\n    a default color for when they are toggled away from None.\n  - Simplify API on color slices to just return a single color; we never ended\n    up needing an NSSet.\n  - The inspected objects is now an NSArray instead of NSSet, allowing us to\n    preserve the 'first' selected object (important when selecting text runs,\n    for example).\n  - When inspectors are updated, the get passed a reason that can allow them\n    to perform less work. Typically they'll avoid reloading a UITableView\n    since the calling code is going to do it in an animated way.\n  - OUIActionInspectorSlices can be configured to start editing when they\n    appear.\n  - Color pickers selection is by identifier instead of index.\n  - Can disable the automatic picking of the appropriate color pane for a\n    given selection.\n  - Split the font inspector into multiple slices and made them more\n    subclassable for OmniOutliner.\n  - Added a dark mode for OUIInspectorSegmentedControl.\n  - Add support for placeholder text in OUIInspectorTextWell.\n  - Better handling of memory warnings.\n  - Improved support for automatically laying out inspector slices based on\n    border edge insets.\n\nOmniUI/Export:\n  - Added support for importing/exporting file wrappers.\n  - Improved support for picking an export format.\n\nOmniUI/General:\n  - Added OUICustomSubclass helpers to allow applications to specify subclasses\n    to be used by superclasses that adopt its support.\n  - We now do our own 'bar button item' popover presentation to avoid\n    positioning bugs with custom view toolbar items.\n  - Added a 'clear' toolbar button border type, used by OmniOutliner.\n  - Lots of other smaller bug fixes.\n  - Fixed up a bunch of document picker animation/performance issues.\n  - Added a scroller on the docuemnt picker to quickly scroll through the list\n    of documents.\n  - More support for UTI mapping, exports, and email of nice attachments/HTML.\n  - Added OUIGestureRecognizer superclass, for common behavior for some of our\n    custom recognizers. Merged a bunch of work for OmniGraffle/iPad on long\n    press and rotation recognizers.\n  - Added support for displaying an image before the text in OUIOverlayView.\n  - Added some debugging support for logging UIPopoverController size changes.\n\nOmniUnzip:\n  - Added conveniences for dealing with file wrappers, using OFFileWrapper\n    for iOS support.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-05-05 12:38:20-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-05-05 11:04:48-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Move HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS up into the common config.\n\nAvoid filename collisions among YACC/Bison grammars' derived files.\n\nUpdated our Xcode settings to strip all symbols from iOS apps.

Gave it better\n  highlight and disabled looks.\n- Improved default font selection in OUIInspectorTextWell.\n- Added real images for paragraph alignments.\n- Added a maximum height setting for the view autosizing for inspectors\n  containing table views (past which point the table view will just be\n  scrollable).\n- Added more hooks on OUIEditableFrame for getting/setting text attributes\n  from inspectors, including adjusting the typingAttributes if the selection\n  is zero-length.\n- Added more flexible selection updating for table views acting as a multi-\n  selection control via OUITableViewFinishedReactingToSelectionWithPredicate.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 11:21:48-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 11:04:25-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Ignore Xcode 4 cruft.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 11:04:25-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:48:13-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Removed old file.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:48:13-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:47:54-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Fixed some 64-bit-ificataion.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:47:54-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:47:06-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Fix zombie noted by ToT clang-sa: -awakeAfterUsingCoder: should return a\nretained object.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:47:06-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:46:01-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Fix warning from ToT clang; equality checks inside ((...)) are flagged as\npossible errors now.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:46:01-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:45:00-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Improved vector rendering path.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:45:00-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:43:39-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Add a link dependency on OmniAppKit so Xcode 4's implicit build depedencies\nwill work.\n\nWe got away with this before since we only use category methods added in OA\nand all the targets linking OQ also linked OA.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2011-02-15 09:43:39-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2011-02-15 09:41:16-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Updated to #import OFXMLBuffer instead of using a struct tag pointer since\nthis produces a warning with ToT clang (correctly).

If found, register them just like defaults in bundle Info.plists/OFRegistrations. This allows us to split our shared defaults out of framework Info.plists and use the *.defaults files on both platforms.\n  - Add convenience wrapper for CFPropertyList {de,}serialization, hiding the API difference between Mac OS X 10.6/iOS 4.x and iOS 3.x.\n  - Split out NSData hash support and include that on the iOS side.\n\nOmniUI/General:\n  - New flatter toolbar button look, still a work in progress too.\n  - Split out OUIParameters.h to expose knobs to our UI folks for tuning.\n  - Added app-global system for managing the current popover to help avoid multiple-popover-avoidance code bloat (something similar really should be built-into UIKit).\n  - Added OUICertificateTrustAlert and use it in the WebDAV integration.\n  - Some cleanup in document system of previews, UTI helpers and document lifecycle.\n  - Support for hiding the toolbar in OUIToolbarViewController.\n  - Fixed keyboard avoidance for toggling between multiple keyboards changing the keyboard height.\n  - Added helper functions for updating table view rows for selection changes.\n  - Added OUIWithAppropriateLayerAnimations(^{...}) for passing UIKit animation down to CA in UIView setters that poke the layer's animated properties.\n\nOmniUI/Inspectors:\n\t- New lighter look for inspector controls.

Now sub-panes can override the selected object set.\n\t- Single-color swatch picker support for inspectors (like in OmniGraffle).\n\t- Clean up font inspector to be a bit more iWork-y (sans some of iWork's bugs).\n\t- Deprecated old inspector delegate methods, replacing with a version that passes the pane that is asking.\n\t- Fix bug that prevented inspector from being closed in some cases.\n  - Switch OUIInspectorTextWell to use OUIEditableFrame for editing to avoid jumpy transition.\n  - Add support for left-label/right-value mode in OUIInspectorTextWell.\n  - Following iWork's lead, hide inspectors on undo/redo rather than trying to keep them up to date.

Better support for right/center aligned text.\n\nOmniUI/TextEditor sample:\n  - Added toolbar item and supporting code to demo/debug text attachments.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n  - Add placeholder support for NSTextAttachment and NSTextAttachmentCell standins for iOS.\n  -

There is also a method -resetHysteresis which causes the tracking to start over from the current location of the finger(s).  This is useful for nudging -- if the first finger is slowly drifting while the user performs a nudge swipe with a second finger, we don't want that first finger's movement to interfere with the precise nudging (so we reset the hysteresis with every nudge).  I converted some of the GesturePlayground classes to use this new abstracted hysteresis tracking.\n\nThis basically completes the functionality of the built-in UILongPressGestureRecognizer when used for dragging/resizing/panning.  In case I haven't said this before, there are a lot of reasons to use LongPress GRs instead of Pan GRs -- even when you don't care about using the built-in delay.  One reason is that they will always \"recognize\" before the UIScrollView's Pan GR kicks in.  Another reason is that a LongPress GR with a delay of about 0.02 seconds leaves enough time for a second finger to hit the screen, cleanly allowing two-finger gestures to occur.\n\n(The default UILongPressGestureRecognizer does in fact utilize hysteresis behind the scenes, but it only takes effect before the delay timer finishes.  i.e. if your finger doesn't move more than 10 pixels before the timer fires, it's considered a long press.  But any movement *after* that causes a \"changed\" event regardless.

The existing iPhone/iPad code has been wrapped up into static library targets for easier use (of course, only a subset of the code has been ported to iPhone OS, as needed).\n\nDetails follow:\n\nOmniUI/iPad:\n  - First release of this framework!\n  - Includes a bunch of features from our iPad apps\n    - Document picker, basic document-based application support\n    - CoreText-based text editor (still a work in progress, but a great start)\n      - We'll be working more on performance for large blobs of text, which we haven't needed yet.\n    - Zooming/tiling scroll view system\n    - Extensible inspector system; includes full font and color inspectors (palette, hsv, rgb, gray)\n    - widgets (thumb wheel, color swatches, toggle buttons, matching segmented control, editable text well)\n  - Support for sending feedback, exporting documents/PDF via Mail, documentation, etc.\n  - See examples in OmniGroup/Frameworks/OmniUI/iPad/Examples\n    - The text editor example is still in progress, but isn't fully hooked up yet (no inspectors yet)\n  - Gesture recognizer debugging helper (logs all events and state changes)\n  - \"Direct\" tap recognizer subclass\n  - Overlay hint view (for example, showing the % zoom level while in the middle of a zoom gesture).\n  - Basic RTF reading/writing\n\nOmniQuartz:\n  - First release of this framework!\n  - Includes a subset as a static library OmniQuartzTouch target for iPhone OS.\n  - Includes lots of CALayer debugging support, helpers (log all animations, logging of layer trees, vector output for layer trees)\n  - Includes some basic drawing routings for\n  - Includes some simple CoreImage utilities\n  - Includes a class cluster of color component preserving color classes. UIColor is more \"build-only\". OQColor remembers the components you gave it and acts more like a model object (including XML and plist archiving support based on NSColor(OAExtensions)).\n  - Includes delayed layer removal animations (since removing a layer normally is instantaneous in CA unless you want default animation).\n  - Includes a (perspective correct) view transition flip animation\n  - Includes a 'hole' layer.\n\nConfigurations:\n  - Consolidated some Mac and iPhone settings such that the Omni-Global-* files are shared between platforms.\n  - Added Target-{Mac,Touch}-* configurations for target-specific options\n  - Added support for static libraries on the iPhone, that act somewhat like frameworks\n\nGeneral:\n  - Various clang + llvm 2.7 static warnings and static analyzer fixes\n  - Made various bits of constant data be marked 'const' (notification names, dictionary keys, etc)\n  - More work on GC support. Still not there.\n  - Switched from NS geometry types to CG types in many places. -DNS_BUILD_32_LIKE_64 is your friend.\n  - Rearranged/refactored extensions into separate files to allow porting smaller relevant chunks to iPhone OS\n\nScripts:\n  - Added a script to export a strings file based on the files that were compiled into a static library. It's a hack.\n  - Added a script that can be run from an iPad app to merge resources exported by the static library projects. See the \"Copy Library Resources\" script phase in OmniGroup/Frameworks/OmniUI/iPad/Examples/TextEditor for an example.\n\nFixStringsFile:\n  - Added this little tool we use to sort and do basic ASCII->Unicode substitution on strings files (\"...\" becomes an ellipsis, for example).\n\nOmniBase:\n  - Added OmniBaseTouch static library target for iPhone/iPad\n  - Removed OBError/OBErrorWithInfo macros. These weren't suitable for iPad development where OMNI_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER might be the main bundle. Each framework domain should define its own macros and own domain global NSString key.\n  - Added OBLoadBundle tool. This is is useful to run the OmniBase ABI consistency checks on arbitrary frameworks/bundles.\n  - Added OBAssertThrows, which is just like STAssertThrows but doesn't provoke a clang-sa warning.\n  - Added scanned memory allocation wrapper macros that do a reasonable job of working when GC is enabled or not.\n  - Make OMNI_BUNDLE work on iPad (just trivially the main bundle in that case).\n  - Added OBFinishPortingLater(). This will warn once when hit.\n  - Added _OBIsNegative helpers and OBASSERT_NONNEGATIVE macro. This is useful for avoiding clang warnings about comparing unsigned vs. zero.\n  - Define the NS_RETURNS_RETAINED clang-sa helper macro, if it isn't defined already since iPhone OS 3.2 doesn't define this.\n  - Turn off RCS_ID strings on iPhone. No one is going to run ident on the executable and the executable size matters more here.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n  - Added OmniFoundationTouch with the common set of classes/extensions our apps need. You might want to tweak it for your own use.\n  - Disable libbz2 compression support on iPhone OS. libbz2 is present, but the headers aren't and Apple considers this private API.\n  - Split out a OFEnumNameTable(OFXMLArchiving) category in separate files. Nice if you don't want any of the XML support in your library.\n\t- Added -[OFMultiValueDictionary parametersFromQueryString] for parsing URL query strings.\n\t- OFFilterProcess uses POSIX spawn() if possible. Also fixed some GC issues.\n  - Added OFNetChangeNotifier.\n  - Added -[OFPreference coerceStringValue:toTypeOfPropertyListValue] -- used in the preference setting URL support in our iPhone OS apps\n  - Added OFSaveType; a mirror of NSSaveOperation, but available on iPad.\n  - Added more block-based helpers on NSArray, -indexByBlock, -firstInRange:that:, -last:, -lastInRange:that:\n  - Added ICS-formatted NSDate/NSString conversion methods in NSDate(OFExtensions).\n  - Added block-based -[NSString(OFExtensions) strinByPerformingReplacement:onCharacters:options:range:].\n  - Added OFASN1DescribeOID()\n\nOmniFoundation/OmniAppKit:\n  - Added some stand-in classes or stubs for AppKit classes. More refinement to come.\n\n\t  OFFileWrapper\n    OAFontDescriptor\n    OAParagraphStyle\n    OAMutableParagraphStyle\n    OATextTab\n\n  - New OmniAppKitTouch target with just these stand-ins.\n  - New OAStepperTextField control.\n  - Removed deprecated support for document backups using resource forks.\n  - Removed support for fixing up HFS attributes on written file wrappers.

Added OmniUnzip, an ObjC wrapper for reading and writing zip files, based on 'minizip'.\n  - Added OmniFileStore, which provides a NSFileManager-like interface, but using NSURLs, to find/read/write files across the local filesystem or WebDAV.\n\nConfigurations and Scripts:\n  - Require 10.6\n  - Use @rpath instead of @executable_path\n  - Build with gcc 4.2 and the clang static analyzer (top-of-tree is much improved and we build with that too if you want to edit the configs)\n  - Enabled 64->32 implicit conversion warnings. This catches lots of crufty code at the expense of some spurious warnings.\n  - Added our workaround for an Xcode misfeature where unit test don't get run for release builds.\n\nGeneral:\n  - Lots of 64-bit cleanup.\n    - In some cases, we've just #if'd out code and replaced it with OBFinishPorting (which raises when we hit it).\n    - Much of OWF and OIF, for example, are slated to be trimmed out since we no longer use them.\n  - Removed lots of pre-10.6 code and switched to 10.6 variants where applicable. More left to be done.\n  - Removed other code that we weren't using any more (instead of porting it w/o a real world test).\n  - Various leak and bug fixes found via top-of-tree clang\n  - Some work towards GC support.\n\nOmniBase:\n  - Extended and improved our runtime signature verification. This does things like ensure you didn't impelement a protocol and return a 32-bit type when you should have returned a 64-bit type, etc.\n  - Factored C core API out of some code to better allow inclusion of only C files in system bundles (to avoid possibility of namespace conflicts)\n\nOmniFoundation:\n  - Factored C core API out of some code to better allow inclusion of only C files in system bundles (to avoid possibility of namespace conflicts)\n  - Added OFExtent; NSRange but with floats.\n  - OFHeap uses blocks now.\n  - OFRandom is now a wrapper around \"SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister\" from <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html>\n  - A bunch more work on signed XML support, CDSA wrappers.\n  - Add some simple block category methods to containers. More obviously could be done, but we're only adding them as we use them.\n\nOmniFileStore\n  - First public release.\n  - Vaguely NSFileManager-like API that handles local filesystems and WebDAV.\n  - Includes support for https credentials, typically stored in Keychain, via a delegate (since the actual Keychain APIs differ between iPhone and Mac OS X).\n  - Support for asynchronous operations (not all implemented).\n  - Doesn't do everything, notably, no support for condiional GETs, properties, ETags.\n  - Includes a 'ofs' command line tool, mostly for testing.\n\nOmniUnzip:\n  - Our ObjC wrapper around the 'minizip' tool.\n  - Handles NSFileWrapper <-> zip archive\n  - Handles regular, link and directory file types along with basic metadata.\n  - Support for moving raw zip members between archives w/o decompressing and recompressing them.\n\nOmniDataObjects:\n  - Added support for declaring properties as being calculated. This makes the properties readonly.\n  - For one-to-one relationships, require that exactly one side is marked calculated.\n  - Added starts-with and contains predicate support for strings.\n  - Added support for marking objects as undeletable.\n  - Updated delete propagation to issue KVO for to-one relationships of the objects in the deletion set. Also, deleted objects return nil for to-one accessors instead of asserting and crashing.  This allows \"foo.bar\" key path observations to work (which we didn't use in previous versions).\n  - Added some (partial) sanity checking that a predicate used for in-memory vs. SQL qualification will result in the same set of objets matching.\n  - Unconditionally support undo, since the iPhone does now.\n  - Removed our NSPredicate implementation, now that the iPhone has it (we still have support for building SQL qualifiers, of course).\n\nOmniAppKit:\n  - Added our (semi-experimental) OATargetSelection categories for customizing the responder chain and finding target for actions more robustly. YMMV.  See <http://www.cocoatoa.com/posts/2009/12/08/modernizing_the_responder_chain/> for some notes.\n  - Some support for block-based NSAlert completion hooks.\n  - More support for quarantine property operations via NSFileManager category methods.\n  - NOTE: Many of the tests of the bezier extensions are currently failing due to precision changes when building 64-bit. More updates in the future...\n\nOmniSoftwareUpdate:\n  - More work on signed feeds\n  - Support for compressing common OpenGL extensions into a bitset.\n  - Fixes to querying display properties.\n  - OpenCL details added to query\n  - UI improvements\n  - More fixes and bullet-proofing of install process\n  - Beginnings of tool to automate appcast feed generation, including signature generation.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2010-01-20 13:37:03-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2010-01-20 11:03:24-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Detabify.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2010-01-20 11:03:24-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2010-01-20 11:01:37-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Remove references to Xcode 2.2.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2010-01-20 11:01:37-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2010-01-20 11:00:04-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Rename Build-Xcode2.2 to just Build since we only support recent Xcode versions.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2010-01-20 11:00:04-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2010-01-20 10:59:25-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Removing the Build link.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2010-01-20 10:59:25-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2009-08-28 00:55:15-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Missed one last string encoding warning.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2009-08-28 00:55:15-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2009-08-28 00:52:15-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Uncomment -quarantinePropertiesForItemAtPath:error:.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2009-08-28 00:52:15-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2009-08-28 00:49:50-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Fix a few issues building the 10.5 branch on 10.6.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2009-08-28 00:49:50-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2009-08-28 00:29:31-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Batch applied changes up to r118113 from Omni's svn.\n\nThe highlights of the changes follow.\n\nConfigurations:\n\t- Switched to dwarf-with-dsym for valgrind\n\t- Added a series of Library configurations\n\nOmniBase:\n\t- Fixed clang-sa issues\n\t- Split up out the C NSError helper functions into their own file for inclusion in Quick Look / Spotlight bundles.\n\t- Added option to include backtrace where NSErrors are generated (at least with the OB calls)\n\t- Added/improved runtime checking for common method signature errors:\n\t\t- Subclass signature differs from superclass or attached protocol (possible 64-bit issue)\n\t\t- Implementing deprecated methods, including support for defining them via protocols including 'Deprecated' in their name.\n\t- Whitelist some more Cocoa methods.\n\t- Added support for running code coverage from unit tests, though it uses Omni-internal scripts right now.\n\t- Added macros for the clang attributes {ns,cf}_returns_retained\n\t- Added OBBuildByCompilerVersion global CFStringRef\n\t- Added OB_UNUSED_VALUE macro to help hint to clang that a dead store is OK.\n\t- Updated assertion macros to cooperate with clang-sa, using the analyzer_noreturn attribute.\n\t- Added OBASSERT_NULL and OBASSERT_NOTNULL macros to help inform clang-sa of guarantees we make.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n\t- Fixed clang-sa issues\n\t- Removed pre-10.5 compatability code\n\t- Fixed some 64-bit issues\n\t- Added CF callback helpers for NS{U,}Integer types\n\t- Added SHA-256 signature support and cleaned up NSData signature generation.\n\t- Removed some whole classes and various other methods we no longer use (OFBitField, OFOid)\n\t- A bit of progress on GC support, though more work remains\n\t- Various other cleanup & modernization in surrounding code\n\t- Added CDSA helpers for dealing with certificates, signatures and the like\n\t- Various improvements/cleanup in OFFilterProcess.

Not currently supporting setting whole to-one relationships; on the assumption that it is easy to set the inverse to-ones.\n- Added class<->entity mapping, though I'm not too happy with it yet. See commentary at +[ODOObject resolveInstanceMethod:]\n- Tweaked the derived/non-date modifying property registration API\n- Added a sample iPhone application that shows how to set up the dependencies to get OmniDataObjects to build in that context.\n- Added a bit of support for non-Omni build environments.\n- Added some more CoreData/ODO perf comparison tests.\n\nLots of other small fixes, cleanup and removal of code we aren't using any more.", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2008-12-28 22:17:52-08:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2008-12-28 22:01:22-08:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Be more selective of the files we convert $ -> $.

deallocations as assertion failures; the backtrace where\n  this occurs isn't interesting so there is no point stopping in the debugger.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n- Read and write the passphrase hint, and plumb it through to the prompt dialog\n  and to the encryption settings object stored in the document model.\n  Also fixed some unit-test rot.\n- Made error info more informative for files whose TOC is inconsistent.\n  Wrapped some code that can potentially generate large autoreleased NSDatas\n  in an autorelease pool.\n- Pulling some AEAD-mode unit tests out of the back of the closet.\n- Fixed a bug in CBCMAC computation when buffers weren't aligned to AES block\n  boundaries. This slightly changes the semantics of the OFAEAD functions to\n  allow partial blocks (easier to deal with it there than at the call sites).\n  Also added a test which exposes the bug.\n- The version of CCSymmetricKeyUnwrap() that ships with iOS 10.2 beta and\n  macOS 10.12.2 beta has changed its error return slightly. It previously\n  returned -1 for most (all?) errors, but now returns kCCParamError.\n  This causes us trouble when attempting to differentiate between an error\n  caused by a genuine bad parameter and one caused by an unwrapping failure.\n\n  To work around this, introduce a wrapper function OFSymmetricKeyUnwrap()\n  that calls CCSymmetricKeyUnwrap() and does some error rewriting.\n\n  OFCryptoTest now also tests OFSymmetricKeyUnwrap() in addition to the\n  existing CCSymmetricKeyUnwrap() checks (and gets a little reorganization\n  along the way).\n\nOmniSoftwareUpdate:\n- Add late 2016 MacBook Pros to the OSUDevices list\n- Move registration of a few defaults to the OmniSoftwareUpdates.defaults file.\n\nOmniUnzip:\n- Fixed a crash which occurred when we encountered a failure to open a zip\n  archive.\n- The streaming decompression support in OUUnzipArchive broke in the situation\n  where the archive does not exist on the local disk. Fixed that and made the\n  internal API clearer that it's a possibility.\n- The only use of the path argument for an archive backed by a byte provider was\n  for generating error messages. The display name for error messages now has its\n  own instance variable.\n- The external API, for the handful of places we create an OUUnzipArchive from\n  a data blob, now explicitly separates the \"description:\" parameter from the\n  \"path:\" parameter and fails if you try to supply both a path and a byte provider.\n\nOmniUI/iPad-Document:\n- Add an activity indicator to the document picker and make it spin when\n deleting documents.\n\nOmniAppKit:\n- Don't ask a color for its .colorSpace until we've tested that it\n  doesn't belong to the named or pattern color space (which we test for\n  by name).\n- Support for showing hint text when prompting for a passphrase.\n- Add a notion of 'auxiliary' window controllers to OADocument via a category\n  on NSWindowController (defaulting to NO / non-auxiliary).", "repo_description": "Source for many of The Omni Group's frameworks", "generate_at": "2017-05-11 23:42:02-07:00", "author_id": 7187, "repo_name": "omnigroup/OmniGroup"}, {"repo_id": 97752, "repo_owner_id": 7189, "commit_at": "2017-05-11 23:19:22-07:00", "committer_id": 7187, "message": "Updated with changes from OmniGroup svn [273500:274000]\n\nConfigurations:\n- Don't codesign watchOS frameworks when building; they get codesigned\n  when copied into the app.\n\nOmniBase:\n- Add Swift wrapper for OBExpectedDeallocation.\n- Make OBLogger more swift-friendly.\n\nOmniFoundation:\n- Avoid crash if OFMultipleOptionErrorRecovery is called with out-of-bounds recoveryOptionIndex.\n\nOmniDataObjects:\n- Fixed a latent bug in _updateResultSetForChanges in\n  ODOEditingContext-Internal.m, where any updated objects are excluded from\n  the fetch if the fetch has a nil predicate.\n\nOmniFileExchange:\n- Added \"Library\" to our OFXDangerousSierraFolders list.\n- Renamed an `error` local variable to be more specific about where it was being used.\n- Add another NSError local for another use (cleaning up a temporary file) to\n  avoid clobbering the real error before returning.

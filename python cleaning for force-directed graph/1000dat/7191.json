To make\nmatters worse, its serialization/deserialization is in the guts of a\nDynoDriver.\n\nSuperficially, this is an alarming destruction of abstraction barriers,\nbut not so much in light of what a \"ControlDir\" is at a detailed level:\nto be a compact, no-frills, serializable data structure describing all\nthe same data any poller needs to respond.  It is the concrete variant\nof the interface-driven approach used to return data from pollers\nthusfar (e.g. the \"Formation\" interface).\n\nIn light of how useful serializing rich values to instruct descended\nhsup processes is, perhaps all pollers ought to be adjusted to yield a\nsingle, concrete implementation (that would be exactly like\n\"ControlDir\") rather than support any kind of polymorphism via\ninterfaces as is currently the case.\n\nThis organizational and naming snarl is worthwhile removing if this\npatch survives service to a larger goal: making the CONTROL_DIR\nfunctionality work, and in particular supporting both http and\nfile-driven image building.  Before, this was busted and it appeared it\nsome futzing around with volumes and binds to fix it, but I found this\nharder than anticipated when trying to achieve it.\n\nOn this unexpected difficulty: I chose this design after experimenting\nwith another.  That approach was using the CONTROL_DIR format to teach\nthe hsup self-invocation what to do.  Implied in this is file\ngeneration, manipulation, and particularly sharing, and in this are the\nseeds of that approach's undoing:\n\n* There a lot more that can go wrong that requires error handling in\n  code paths where one can do without such failure modes.\n\n* Dockerfiles don't support bind mounting from the host, presumably as\n  it defeats the portability that is a goal of that format: one would\n  have to write a bunch of code to start a series of containers with\n  bind mounts to the host.\n\n* One needs to dispose of temporary directories when an Executor is\n  completely done with. So one needs to bloat a new operator to dispose\n  of it, as well as fields to track what to clean up.  And, that\n  clean-up has failure modes, too.\n\n* The CONTROL_DIR hot loading support needs to move and create files,\n  and file UID/GID mapping through bind mounts in other containers is\n  complex.  It gets worse when one considers how boot2docker does file\n  sharing on Macintosh: then *three* possible interpretations or\n  mangling of file UIDs come into play.\n\nFinally, the useful part about CONTROL_DIR -- the ability to poll and\nhot-load the contents -- is not employed at all inside a container,\nbecause a new release triggers a start of a new container, and that's a\nperfect opportunity to inject the immutable HSUP_CONTROL_GOB.  This\nfastidiousness is of little consequence if the system degenerated well\notherwise, but it did not.  The HSUP_CONTROL_GOB style, sacrificing the\nnever-used hot-updates, eliminates a ton of complexity, and teaches an\nobject lesson: do not underestimate file management and containers.", "repo_description": "Supervises processes that are configured in a Heroku-esque way.", "generate_at": "2015-01-17 23:24:25-08:00", "author_id": 7191, "repo_name": "heroku/hsup"}, {"repo_id": 24661448, "repo_owner_id": 23211, "commit_at": "2015-01-17 22:26:18-08:00", "committer_id": 7191, "message": "Remove vestigial environment variable setting\n\nThis is a holdover of when dockerd would execute a user process\ndirectly.

To make\nmatters worse, its serialization/deserialization is in the guts of a\nDynoDriver.\n\nSuperficially, this is an alarming destruction of abstraction barriers,\nbut not so much in light of what a \"ControlDir\" is at a detailed level:\nto be a compact, no-frills, serializable data structure describing all\nthe same data any poller needs to respond.  It is the concrete variant\nof the interface-driven approach used to return data from pollers\nthusfar (e.g. the \"Formation\" interface).\n\nIn light of how useful serializing rich values to instruct descended\nhsup processes is, perhaps all pollers ought to be adjusted to yield a\nsingle, concrete implementation (that would be exactly like\n\"ControlDir\") rather than support any kind of polymorphism via\ninterfaces as is currently the case.\n\nThis organizational and naming snarl is worthwhile removing if this\npatch survives service to a larger goal: making the CONTROL_DIR\nfunctionality work, and in particular supporting both http and\nfile-driven image building.  Before, this was busted and it appeared it\nsome futzing around with volumes and binds to fix it, but I found this\nharder than anticipated when trying to achieve it.\n\nOn this unexpected difficulty: I chose this design after experimenting\nwith another.  That approach was using the CONTROL_DIR format to teach\nthe hsup self-invocation what to do.  Implied in this is file\ngeneration, manipulation, and particularly sharing, and in this are the\nseeds of that approach's undoing:\n\n* There a lot more that can go wrong that requires error handling in\n  code paths where one can do without such failure modes.\n\n* Dockerfiles don't support bind mounting from the host, presumably as\n  it defeats the portability that is a goal of that format: one would\n  have to write a bunch of code to start a series of containers with\n  bind mounts to the host.\n\n* One needs to dispose of temporary directories when an Executor is\n  completely done with. So one needs to bloat a new operator to dispose\n  of it, as well as fields to track what to clean up.  And, that\n  clean-up has failure modes, too.\n\n* The CONTROL_DIR hot loading support needs to move and create files,\n  and file UID/GID mapping through bind mounts in other containers is\n  complex.  It gets worse when one considers how boot2docker does file\n  sharing on Macintosh: then *three* possible interpretations or\n  mangling of file UIDs come into play.\n\nFinally, the useful part about CONTROL_DIR -- the ability to poll and\nhot-load the contents -- is not employed at all inside a container,\nbecause a new release triggers a start of a new container, and that's a\nperfect opportunity to inject the immutable HSUP_CONTROL_GOB.  This\nfastidiousness is of little consequence if the system degenerated well\notherwise, but it did not.  The HSUP_CONTROL_GOB style, sacrificing the\nnever-used hot-updates, eliminates a ton of complexity, and teaches an\nobject lesson: do not underestimate file management and containers.", "repo_description": "As fdr/hsup redirects to heroku/hsup, make another repo for my own work", "generate_at": "2015-01-17 23:24:25-08:00", "author_id": 7191, "repo_name": "fdr/hsup-fdr"}, {"repo_id": 30563633, "repo_owner_id": 7191, "commit_at": "2015-01-17 22:26:18-08:00", "committer_id": 7191, "message": "Remove vestigial environment variable setting\n\nThis is a holdover of when dockerd would execute a user process\ndirectly.

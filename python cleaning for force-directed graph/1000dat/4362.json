It was\na pretty easy follow on from the \"small methods\" refactoring done\nin the previous step. I went back and watched the video of her\ntalk again and my solution ended up pretty close to hers. Essentially,\nthe GildedRose class becomes module that is a factory of the various\nItem subclasses. I did deviate from her solution in a couple places.\nFirst, I overrode the .new method on the module. This did feel a bit\nsmelly to me, but otherwise it would have required changing the tests\nand I interpreted that as cheating. (Sandi use a .for method instead.\nPresumably this required changes to the tests, but she didn't show\nthat.) Second, she replaced the case statement that maps names to\nclasses with a config Hash. Her solution assumes that all normal items\nare called \"Normal\". I think this is an oversight. The tests (fm where?\nnot Jim's, but probably based on them.) assigned \"Normal\" to the names\nof the object, but that appears to be a generic. If you read the\noriginal problem description (and look at the original code) the\nimplication is that \"normal\" refers to an object with any name that\ndoesn't match one of the special cases. I also wanted to allow for\ndifferent kinds of \"Backstage pass to ....\" and \"Conjured ....\". This\nrequires matching on patterns rather than whole strings. With all that\nin mind, I think sticking with the case statement is best.\n\nThis refactoring took the overall flog score down from 45.8 to 45.0,\nThe method average down from 6.5 to 5.0.
